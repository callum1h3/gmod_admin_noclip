# gmod_admin_noclip

This addon will allow your admins to observe players and not be caught in the process by cheats such as ESP
or Wall hack, This is done by having a client side noclip then sending the information to the server,
this will be processed and a invisable entity will follow your client side camera. No one can see the
entity because PVS is set to off on it.
